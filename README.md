# todo-list-web

App to practise test driving a web application.

### Running the tests
`rspec` 
Some of these tests are failing and the idea is add unit tests and code to make the feature tests pass

### Running the app
`rackup`

### Adding a database

Can you refactor this code that the data is persisted in a database rather than in the model?
